### hints 

* the center text in the template uses a trick from link #2
* the imges are to be positioned as `absolute` in order to place them correctly. 
* for making buttons render side by side either use lists and make `display: inline` or use a parent and child `<div>` and set parent's display to `display: inline-flex`|`flex`.                                                                       

### extra work

* you'll have to use photoshop or something similar to remove the background from the image.
* search for - "photoshop/something-else make image background transprent".
